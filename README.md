# BRmesh_Home_Assistant
This is millskyle's project, all I've done is change a couple of things to get it to compile on Arduino IDE.
It can be found here https://github.com/millskyle/BRMesh_homeassistant
Currently I have uploaded it to a ESP32-DEV board, but not tested it.

Note: I did have to change the partition scheme to "No OTA" in order to have enough memory.
